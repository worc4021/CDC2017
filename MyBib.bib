abstract = {Random convex programs (RCPs) are convex optimization problems subject to a finite number of constraints (scenarios) that are extracted according to some probability distribution. The optimal objective value of an RCP and its associated optimal solution (when it exists), are random variables: RCP theory is mainly concerned with providing probabilistic assessments on the objective and on the probability of constraint violation for the RCP solution. In a two-parts contribution, we give a self-contained overview of RCP theory by both re-deriving and extending known results via new proofs, and by providing novel advancements. In this first-part paper we introduce the basic concepts and derive an explicit and tight upper bound on the objective and constraint violation probability of RCPs. This novel derivation allows for a much wider applicability with respect to existing results, since it requires no hypothesis of existence of the solution. The companion paper is then concerned with RCPs with a-posteriori violated constraints (RCPVs), exploring in particular their connections with chance constrained problems.},

@article{Margellos:2014,
abstract = {We propose a new method for solving chance constrained optimization problems that lies between robust optimization and scenario- based methods. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the underlying probability distribution as in robust optimization methods, nor is it based entirely on randomization as in the scenario approach. It instead involves solving a robust optimization problem with bounded uncertainty, where the uncertainty bounds are randomized and are com- puted using the scenario approach. To guarantee that the resulting robust problem is solvable we impose certain assumptions on the dependency of the constraint functions with respect to the uncertainty and show that tractability is ensured for a wide class of systems. Our results lead immediately to guidelines under which the proposed methodology or the scenario approach is preferable in terms of providing less conservative guarantees or reducing the computational cost.},
